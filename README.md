  > _"Digital communication, has gotten us accustomed to the edited life, we've got to reconsider that the unedited life is also worth living."_

  > _"Conversation, like life, has silences. It has boring bits. And it's often in the moments when we stumble, and we hesitate, and we fall silent, and we're not so perfect, that we reveal ourself to each other."_

  > _"The capacity for solitude, is closely linked to the capacity for relationship."_
  
  > _"Remember that the presence of a device [in a conversation] already signals your attention is divided."_

  > For anyone who’s ever dated, or maintained any kind of relationship, in the digital age, you have probably known a breadcrumber. They communicate via sporadic noncommittal, but repeated messages — or breadcrumbs — that are just enough to keep you wondering but not enough to seal the deal (whatever that deal may be).

## 07/09/2016

_Soundtrack of the day: The Zero Theorem Original Soundtrack, George Fenton_

[Connected, but alone?](http://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together) (Video duration: 00:19:41)

  > Over the past 15 years, I've studied technologies of mobile communication and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people, young and old, about their plugged in lives. And what I've found is that our little devices, those little devices in our pockets, are so psychologically powerful that they don't only change what we do, they change who we are.

  > And I believe it's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable. And we are vulnerable. We're lonely, but we're afraid of intimacy. And so from social networks to sociable robots, we're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control. But we're not so comfortable. We are not so much in control.

  > "Reading [Moira] Weigel’s “Labor of Love, [The Invention of Dating]” you can get the sense that women are now pinballing among the worst of all the dating systems that have come before. Like the shopgirls of the twenties, Weigel says, we turn ourselves into commodities, typing up dating-site profiles as if they were product descriptions, placing orders on one person and disposing of the next with a single swipe."
