  <p><em>Soundtrack of the day: <strong>COCTEAU TWINS</strong></em></p>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;Lessing is exploring the territory where the personal becomes political (and when I understood that, I realised that it is indeed a sister book to her earlier novels, to books such as The Grass is Singing, where the evils of a political system, apartheid, are exposed through close examination of individual lives).&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;Yet such shark-people (The media image of a terrorist is shark-like in its simplicity) are rare, as Lessing shows us; her terrorists are contaminated by the muddle of being human, have parents they rebel against, have suffered injustices, have maternal impulses and physical needs, and a burning need for identity and recognition. This is not to suggest for a moment that Lessing demands sympathy for her characters; this is no touchy-feely book to help us understand the poor things who are driven to such extremes. It is a witty and furious book, angry at human stupidity and destructiveness, both within the system and without. It shows us people who commit an evil act and it shows how that evil springs out of our own society. It connects us to it, while condemning it. It makes any kind of complacency impossible.&quot;</em></blockquote>

  <blockquote><em>&quot;...the response to the pandemic has unwittingly produced some other large-scale, though less conspicuous, effects. In a bittersweet twist, the surreal slowdown of life as we know it has presented researchers with a rare opportunity to study the modern world under some truly bizarre conditions, and they’re scrambling to collect as much data as they can.&quot;</em></blockquote>

  <blockquote><em>&quot;...our most intimate traits can be very easily predicted from a digital footprint, and a very general one as well, such as Facebook “likes.”&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;One of our most surprising findings is that we could even predict whether your parents were divorced or not, based on your Facebook likes.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;There are many other intimate traits that are also predictable from your digital footprint: smoking, drinking, taking drugs, sexual orientation, religious and political views and so on.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;The second surprising thing is that such a wide range of digital footprints can be used in predictions—even broad measures, such as the number of your friends, number of your likes, how many times you log in to Facebook, how many tweets you have. Each one of those measures is not a very strong predictor of anything on its own. But if you combine many different variables of this kind, each of them slightly predictive, the computer can get a very good idea of who you are.&quot;</em></blockquote>

  <blockquote><em>&quot;Few Facebook likes are so obviously linked with personality or other traits as to allow a human to use them in forming accurate judgments.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;Computers, however, are very good at combining thousands or millions of subtle pieces of information to arrive at accurate predictions.

  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;I think that, in a way, Facebook and other social media might be conveying information that is closer to our true selves than what we reveal in a face-to-face interaction.&quot;</em></blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;The deeper problem is a criminal-justice system in which police officers continue to reflexively disbelieve women who say they’ve been raped—even in this age of the #MeToo movement, and even when DNA testing can confirm many allegations.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;Each year, roughly 125,000 rapes are reported across the United States. [...] But in 49 out of every 50 rape cases, the alleged assailant goes free—often, we now know, to assault again. Which means that rape—more than murder, more than robbery or assault—is by far the easiest violent crime to get away with.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;If a victim couldn’t come to police headquarters on the detective’s timetable—because she couldn’t find transportation or child care or get time off from work—she was labeled “uncooperative.” The case was closed.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;For more than a decade, Liz Garcia had wondered whether her rapist would return to kill her and her daughters, as he’d promised. She suffered panic attacks, sometimes five a day. She avoided answering the door. She showered with the curtain open. She left the light on all night. She slept on the couch, with her back to the wall. “I had knives under my pillows. I hid knives all over the house,” she told me.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;Most rapes, of course, are not committed by strangers. Eighty percent of the time, the rapist is someone a woman knows—they met at a party or a bar; he’s her colleague, friend, mentor, coach.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;This is the question that haunts every advocate, researcher, and enlightened detective or prosecutor I spoke with: How many rapes could have been prevented if the police had believed the first victim, launched a thorough investigation, and caught the rapist? How many women would have been spared a brutal assault?&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;Why would officials decide not to pursue these cases? Campbell and Lovell point to the same factor: law enforcement’s abiding skepticism of women who report being raped.&quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;“We heard over and over detectives use the term righteous victim,” she told me. A woman who didn’t know her assailant, who fought back, who has a clean record and hadn’t been drinking or offering sex for money or drugs—that woman will be taken seriously. Spohn recalled a typical comment: “ ‘If I had a righteous victim, I would do all that I could to make sure that the suspect was arrested. But most of my victims don’t look like that.’ ”&quot;</em></blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;
  The constant barrage of abuse, including death threats and threats of sexual violence, is silencing people, pushing them off online platforms and further reducing the diversity of online voices and opinion. [...] instead of embracing a massive extension of our social circles online, we seem to be reverting to tribalism and conflict.
  &quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;
  "There is a lot of evidence that cooperation is a central feature of human evolution," says [David] Rand [Associate Professor of Management Science & Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT]. Individuals benefit, and are more likely to survive, by cooperating with the group. And being allowed to stay in the group and benefit from it is reliant on our reputation for behaving cooperatively.
  &quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;
  Rather than work out every time whether it’s in our long-term interests to be nice, it’s more efficient and less effort to have the basic rule: be nice to other people. That’s why our unthinking response in the experiment is a generous one.
  &quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;
  "Content that triggers outrage and that expresses outrage is much more likely to be shared," Crockett says. What we’ve created online is "an ecosystem that selects for the most outrageous content, paired with a platform where it’s easier than ever before to express outrage".
  &quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;"Our hypothesis is that the design of these platforms could make expressing outrage into a habit, and a habit is something that’s done without regard to its consequences – it’s insensitive to what happens next, it’s just a blind response to a stimulus," [Molly] Crockett [Assistant Professor of Psychology, Cambridge University] explains.<br>"I think it’s worth having a conversation as a society as to whether we want our morality to be under the control of algorithms whose purpose is to make money for giant tech companies," she adds.
  &quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;
  On the upside, the lower costs of expressing outrage online have allowed marginalised, less-empowered groups to promote causes that have traditionally been harder to advance.
  &quot;</em></blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote><em>&quot;
  As Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil points out, we’ve had thousands of years to hone our person-to-person interactions, but only 20 years of social media. "Offline, we have all these cues from facial expressions to body language to pitch… whereas online we discuss things only through text. I think we shouldn’t be surprised that we’re having so much difficulty in finding the right way to discuss and cooperate online."

      <p><blockquote><em>&quot;It is the story of how a simple statistical formula successfully estimated the number of tanks the enemy was producing, at a time when this could not be directly observed by the allied spy network.&quot;</em></blockquote></p>
      <p><blockquote><em>&quot;The statisticians had one key piece of information, which was the serial numbers on captured mark V tanks. The statisticians believed that the Germans, being Germans, had logically numbered their tanks in the order in which they were produced. And this deduction turned out to be right. It was enough to enable them to make an estimate of the total number of tanks that had been produced up to any given moment.&quot;</em></blockquote></p>
      <p><blockquote><em>&quot;[T]the statisticians reckoned that a good estimator of the number of tanks would probably be provided by the simple equation (M-1)(S+1)/S. [...] By using this formula, statisticians reportedly estimated that the Germans produced 246 tanks per month between June 1940 and September 1942.&quot;</em></blockquote></p>
      <p><blockquote><em>&quot;By using this formula, statisticians reportedly estimated that the Germans produced 246 tanks per month between June 1940 and September 1942. At that time, standard intelligence estimates had believed the number was far, far higher, at around 1,400. After the war, the allies captured German production records, showing that the true number of tanks produced in those three years was 245 per month, almost exactly what the statisticians had calculated, and less than one fifth of what standard intelligence had thought likely.&quot;</em></blockquote></p>

  <blockquote>"Getting started with tech talks: start with lightning talks, preferably at local meetups."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Practice your talks beforehand, preferably with some audience (friends, colleagues). "</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"The time it takes to practice a presentation, will always be off from the real thing. Keep this in time."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Add timing to your slides. For example, you can write a note 'half time' in the middle of the slides, so that when you reach that slide you know whether you need to slow down or speed up if you are off the clock. Try placing time stamps on several slides."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Use a countdown timer"</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Don't stand still! (Audience comment on Brian: "I like that you are walking around!")"</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Read books and watch talks about public speaking"</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"A little bit of silence/pause in the talk is helpful for both you and the audience"
    (it also adds a little bit of drama: what are you going to talk next?)"
    Take a pause, drink some water or coffee if you feel a bit embarrassed."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Have anything prerecorded or in slide format in case live coding/demos break or stop working. Live demos without a backup plan is not good."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Nina's approach for learning and teaching deep tech concepts: take a concept that seems to be out of reach for beginners, breaking it down to the most digestible chunks and then building your talk based on them."</blockquote>

  <p><em>&quot;In effect, YouTube has created a restaurant that serves us increasingly sugary, fatty foods, loading up our plates as soon as we are finished with the last meal. Over time, our tastes adjust, and we seek even more sugary, fatty foods, which the restaurant dutifully provides. When confronted about this by the health department and concerned citizens, the restaurant managers reply that they are merely serving us what we want.&quot;</em></p>

  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;While some biologists in the past have forwarded strict “nature” arguments, contemporary biologists acknowledge that most (if not all) human traits arise due to complex interactions between numerous biological factors (both shared biology and individual biological differences) and environment (both shared culture and individual experiences) to create a broad spectrum of outcomes.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;So in other words, we can say that biological sex differences exist, and also that our understanding of sex is socially constructed — these are not contradictory statements at all.&quot;</em></p>

  <p>By Michael E. Addis / James R. Mahalik / Clark University Boston College</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;A man is least likely to seek help for problems that he sees as unusual, especially when he also perceives them as central to his identity. He is also unlikely to seek help if groups of men who are important to him endorse norms of self-reliance or other norms that suggest his problem is non-normative. Finally, help seeking is less likely to the degree that a man calculates that rejection from an important social group, as well as his view of himself as deviant, are costs too great to risk in relation to the help he might receive. This is especially true if he feels he will sacrifice his autonomy by seeking help.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;There is little doubt that traditional helping services are underutilized by many men experiencing a wide range of problems in living. It is also likely that a variety of masculinity ideologies, norms, and gender roles play a part in discouraging men’s help seeking.&quot;</em></p>

    <p><em>&quot;[T]here is a growing realisation among some neuroscientists that looking at flickers of activity inside our heads can be a misleading way to see how our minds work.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;A team of psychologists at MIT and the University of California at San Diego, who were puzzled by the suspiciously definitive results of many brain-scan studies on these topics, asked the authors of 55 such papers how they had analysed their data. The team reported in 2009 that over half the studies used faulty methods that were guaranteed to shift the results in favour of the correlations they had been looking for between mental activity and blips in parts of the brain.&quot;</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;For Epicurus, tranquillity was the ultimate delight. That is why the real Epicurus – in contrast to the crude sybarite invented by his detractors – denounced the rapidly rotting fruits of dissipation and excess. The constant pursuit of intense pleasures will in fact backfire, according to Epicurus, because it leads to the psychological hell of enslavement to unsatisfiable appetites. The would-be hedonist must take care to ensure that the pain of overreaching desire does not ruin his peace of mind and thereby defeat his original aim of securing a balance of pleasure over pain.&quot;</em></p>

    <p><em>&quot;We could always turn into the disposers. We could be the disposable, but we can also be the disposers. And for that we have to really think hard about Arendt's warnings to all of us. And the warning, I think, Arendt, offers us, a timely one, is that you become a disposer if you begin to look at photographs of people and you just see masses without any stories, or any names. You become a disposer, if you begin to talk about people as categories. You become a disposer when you can no longer tolerate complexity. And that means individual people's lives.&quot;</em></p>

  <p>And I believe it's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable. And we are vulnerable. We're lonely, but we're afraid of intimacy.

We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control. But we're not so comfortable. We are not so much in control.</p>
