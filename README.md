  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Getting started with tech talks: start with lightning talks, preferably at local meetups."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Practice your talks beforehand, preferably with some audience (friends, colleagues). "</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"The time it takes to practice a presentation, will always be off from the real thing. Keep this in time."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Add timing to your slides. For example, you can write a note 'half time' in the middle of the slides, so that when you reach that slide you know whether you need to slow down or speed up if you are off the clock. Try placing time stamps on several slides."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Use a countdown timer"</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Don't stand still! (Audience comment on Brian: "I like that you are walking around!")"</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Read books and watch talks about public speaking"</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"A little bit of silence/pause in the talk is helpful for both you and the audience"
    (it also adds a little bit of drama: what are you going to talk next?)"
    Take a pause, drink some water or coffee if you feel a bit embarrassed."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Have anything prerecorded or in slide format in case live coding/demos break or stop working. Live demos without a backup plan is not good."</blockquote>

  <br/>
  <blockquote>"Nina's approach for learning and teaching deep tech concepts: take a concept that seems to be out of reach for beginners, breaking it down to the most digestible chunks and then building your talk based on them."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;In effect, YouTube has created a restaurant that serves us increasingly sugary, fatty foods, loading up our plates as soon as we are finished with the last meal. Over time, our tastes adjust, and we seek even more sugary, fatty foods, which the restaurant dutifully provides. When confronted about this by the health department and concerned citizens, the restaurant managers reply that they are merely serving us what we want.&quot;</em></p>

  <p><em>Soundtrack of the day: <strong><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Andr%C3%A9+Rieu/Fiesta/Fascination">Andre Rieu - Fascination</a></strong></em></p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;Sex is multifaceted, variable, and somewhat malleable.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;While some biologists in the past have forwarded strict “nature” arguments, contemporary biologists acknowledge that most (if not all) human traits arise due to complex interactions between numerous biological factors (both shared biology and individual biological differences) and environment (both shared culture and individual experiences) to create a broad spectrum of outcomes.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;So in other words, we can say that biological sex differences exist, and also that our understanding of sex is socially constructed — these are not contradictory statements at all.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;Feminism is a movement to end sexism. Trans women face sexism. Ergo, trans women have a stake in feminism.&quot;</em></p>

  <p>By Michael E. Addis / James R. Mahalik / Clark University Boston College</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;A man is least likely to seek help for problems that he sees as unusual, especially when he also perceives them as central to his identity. He is also unlikely to seek help if groups of men who are important to him endorse norms of self-reliance or other norms that suggest his problem is non-normative. Finally, help seeking is less likely to the degree that a man calculates that rejection from an important social group, as well as his view of himself as deviant, are costs too great to risk in relation to the help he might receive. This is especially true if he feels he will sacrifice his autonomy by seeking help.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;There is little doubt that traditional helping services are underutilized by many men experiencing a wide range of problems in living. It is also likely that a variety of masculinity ideologies, norms, and gender roles play a part in discouraging men’s help seeking.&quot;</em></p>

  <p><em>Soundtrack of the day: <strong><a href="http://ambientradio.org">AmbientRadio</a></strong></em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;[T]here is a growing realisation among some neuroscientists that looking at flickers of activity inside our heads can be a misleading way to see how our minds work.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;A team of psychologists at MIT and the University of California at San Diego, who were puzzled by the suspiciously definitive results of many brain-scan studies on these topics, asked the authors of 55 such papers how they had analysed their data. The team reported in 2009 that over half the studies used faulty methods that were guaranteed to shift the results in favour of the correlations they had been looking for between mental activity and blips in parts of the brain.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>It’s worth bearing this in mind the next time you read about a brain-scan study which purportedly reveals how and why we do what we do.</strong></em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;For Epicurus, tranquillity was the ultimate delight. That is why the real Epicurus – in contrast to the crude sybarite invented by his detractors – denounced the rapidly rotting fruits of dissipation and excess. The constant pursuit of intense pleasures will in fact backfire, according to Epicurus, because it leads to the psychological hell of enslavement to unsatisfiable appetites. The would-be hedonist must take care to ensure that the pain of overreaching desire does not ruin his peace of mind and thereby defeat his original aim of securing a balance of pleasure over pain.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;A good Platonist would rather contemplate the perfect meal than eat it.&quot;</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;We could always turn into the disposers. We could be the disposable, but we can also be the disposers. And for that we have to really think hard about Arendt's warnings to all of us. And the warning, I think, Arendt, offers us, a timely one, is that you become a disposer if you begin to look at photographs of people and you just see masses without any stories, or any names. You become a disposer, if you begin to talk about people as categories. You become a disposer when you can no longer tolerate complexity. And that means individual people's lives.&quot;</em></p>

  <p><em>Soundtrack of the day: <strong>The Zero Theorem (Music From the Motion Picture), By George Fenton</strong></em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;Today every branch of science seems intent on demonstrating that the world is supported by the most minute entities, such as the messages of DNA, the impulses of neurons, and quarks, and neutrinos wandering through space since the beginning of time...&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;Lucretius' chief concern is to prevent the weight of matter from crushing us. Even while laying down the rigorous mechanical laws that determine every event, he feels the need to allow atoms to make unpredictable deviations from the straight line, thereby ensuring freedom both to atoms and to human beings.&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;Were I to choose an auspicious image for the new millennium, I would choose this one: The sudden agile leap of the poet-philosopher who raises himself above the weight of the world, showing that with all his gravity he has the secret of lightness, and that what many consider to be the vitality of the times--noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring--belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty, old cars.&quot;</em></p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;Το σημερινό σύστημα μας κάνει όχι μόνο να είμαστε υπό επιτήρηση, αλλά και να παρακολουθούμε κι εμείς τους άλλους. Αυτό είναι η διαστροφή του συστήματος. [...] Δεν είναι εύκολο να αντιληφθείς ότι εσύ ο ίδιος συνεισφέρεις στην παρακολούθησή σου.&quot;</em></p>

Για να μας επιτηρεί κάποιος, αρκούν αυτές οι συσκευές και όσα κάνουμε με αυτές, οι οποίες μετατρέπονται έτσι σε βραχιόλι παρακολούθησης. <strong>Δεν είναι εύκολο να αντιληφθείς ότι εσύ ο ίδιος συνεισφέρεις στην παρακολούθησή σου.</strong>&quot;</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;La vigilancia ya no es como antes. Hoy ya no es necesario pinchar teléfonos porque yo mismo me he comprado mi iPhone, mi ordenador o mi iPad. Basta con vigilar, y se puede hacer a distancia, lo que hago con estos aparatos, que se convierten en una especie de pulsera de seguimiento. No es fácil tomar conciencia de que tú mismo estás contribuyendo a tu propia vigilancia.&quot;</em></p>

[The Agony of the Digital Tease, By Jessica Bennett, The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/fashion/dating-text-messages-breadcrumbing.html) (ERT: 00:05:38 | Words: 1128)

  > For anyone who’s ever dated, or maintained any kind of relationship, in the digital age, you have probably known a breadcrumber. They communicate via sporadic noncommittal, but repeated messages — or breadcrumbs — that are just enough to keep you wondering but not enough to seal the deal (whatever that deal may be).

## 07/09/2016

_Soundtrack of the day: The Zero Theorem Original Soundtrack, George Fenton_

[Connected, but alone?](http://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together) (Video duration: 00:19:41)

  > Over the past 15 years, I've studied technologies of mobile communication and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people, young and old, about their plugged in lives. And what I've found is that our little devices, those little devices in our pockets, are so psychologically powerful that they don't only change what we do, they change who we are.

  > And I believe it's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable. And we are vulnerable. We're lonely, but we're afraid of intimacy. And so from social networks to sociable robots, we're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control. But we're not so comfortable. We are not so much in control.

[The Love App: Romance in the world’s most wired city, By Lauren Collins, The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/25/the-love-app) (ERT: 00:30:54 | Words: 6182)

  > V.C.N.C., a startup based in Seoul, has created an app for couples like Jimin and Yundi. It’s called Between, “a beautiful space where you can share all your moments only with the one that matters.” It provides a private system by which couples exchange voice and text messages, share photo albums, and post notes on a memo board.

  > "Reading [Moira] Weigel’s “Labor of Love, [The Invention of Dating]” you can get the sense that women are now pinballing among the worst of all the dating systems that have come before. Like the shopgirls of the twenties, Weigel says, we turn ourselves into commodities, typing up dating-site profiles as if they were product descriptions, placing orders on one person and disposing of the next with a single swipe."

  > "Another girl tells [Nancy Jo] Sales that social media is “destroying our lives.” Sales asks why she doesn’t quit. “Because then we would have no life,” she is told."
