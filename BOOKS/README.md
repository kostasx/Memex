    <blockquote>
        <p><em>&quot;On the surface it seemed like an ordinary publicity stunt for 'female emancipation'. [...] A contingent of New York debutantes marched down Fifth Avenue in the 1929 Easter Parade, each openly lighting and smoking cigarettes. It was the first time in the memory of most Americans that any woman who wasn't a prostitute had been seen smoking in public. It was dubbed the &quot;torches of liberty contingent&quot; by Edward Bernays, its brilliant behind-the-scenes organizer. [...] later admitted that he had been paid a tidy sum to orchestrate the march by George Washington Hill, president of the American Tobacco Company. [...] it had achieved its goal of breaking the taboo against female smoking.&quot;</em></p>
